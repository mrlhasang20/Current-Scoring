# Scoring System


## Overview
The **Scoring System** project is a financial scoring and prediction pipeline designed to process company data, predict future metrics, and combine current and predicted scores for comprehensive analysis. It is built using Python, leveraging machine learning models and data preprocessing techniques to provide insights into company performance.

## Features
- **Scoring Model**: Calculates scores for companies based on current financial metrics.
- **Prediction Model**: Uses LSTM models to predict future financial metrics for companies.
- **Combined Scoring**: Merges current scores and predicted metrics to generate final scores.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing data, normalization, and caching for efficient processing.
- **Pipeline Execution**: Automates the entire workflow from scoring to prediction and final scoring.
